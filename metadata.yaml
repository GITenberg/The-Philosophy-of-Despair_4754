description: '"The excerpt of a poem that appears at the beginning of this book (Edward
  Fitzgerald''s exquisite version of the Rubāʻiyāt of Omar Khayyám) is perhaps our
  best expression of the sadness and the grandeur of insoluble problems. It is the
  sweetness of philosophical sorrow which has no kinship with misery or distress.
  In the strains of the saddest music the soul finds the keenest delight. The same
  sweet, sorrowful pleasure is felt in the play of the mind about the riddles which
  it cannot solve. In the presence of the infinite problem of life, the voice of Science
  is dumb, for Science is the coordinate and corrected expression of human experience,
  and human experience must stop with the limitations of human life. Man was not present
  "When the foundations of the Earth were laid, " and beyond the certainty that they
  were laid in wisdom and power, man can say little about them. Man finds in the economy
  of nature "no trace of a beginning; no prospect of an end!" He may feel sure, with
  Hutton, that "time is as long as space is wide." But he cannot conceive of space
  as actually without limit, nor can he imagine any limiting conditions. He cannot
  think of a period before time began, nor of a state in which time shall be no more.
  The mind fails before the idea of time''s eternal continuity. So time becomes to
  man merely the sequence of the earthly events in which he and his ancestors have
  taken part. Though the meaning of time, space, existence lies beyond our reach,
  yet some sort of solution of the infinite problem the human heart demands. We find
  in life a power for action, limited though this power may be. Life is action, and
  action is impossible if devoid of motive or hope. It is my purpose here to indicate
  some part of the answer of Science to the Philosophy of Despair. Direct reply Science
  has none. We cannot argue against a singer or a poet. The poet sings of what he
  feels, but Science speaks only of what we know. We feel infinity, but we cannot
  know it, for to the highest human wisdom the ultimate truths of the universe are
  no nearer than to the child. Science knows no ultimate truths. These are beyond
  the reach of man, and all that man knows must be stated in terms of his experience.
  But as to human experience and conduct, Science has a word to say. Therefore Science
  can speak of the causes and results of Pessimism. It can touch the practical side
  of the riddle of life by asking certain questions, the answers to which lie within
  the province of human experience. Among these are the following: Why is there a
  "Philosophy of Despair?" Can Despair be wrought into healthful life? In what part
  of the Universe are you and what are you doing?" (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010
